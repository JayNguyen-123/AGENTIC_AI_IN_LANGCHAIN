# AGENTIC_AI_IN_LANGCHAIN
- Imagine an AI that doesn’t just respond to prompts but actively makes decisions, gathers information, uses tools, stores memory, and works toward a goal without needing you to hold its hand at every step. That’s what agentic AI is all about.
- LangChain has become a potent toolset for creating complex AI applications in the rapidly developing field of artificial intelligence. One of its most intriguing aspects is the agent architecture, which enables programmers to design intelligent systems that can reason, make decisions, and take independent action.
 
We will build agents with capable of explaining any topic via three mediums: Text, Image, or Video

- WikipediaQueryRun: to generate Wikipedia page summaries
- YouTubeSearchTool: to search YouTube videos on topics
- DallEAPIWrapper: to configure how to access OpenAI's DallE endpoint
- OpenAIDALLEImageGenerationTool: to generate images using prompts
